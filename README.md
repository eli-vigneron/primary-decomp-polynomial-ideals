# Primary Decomposition of Polynomial Ideals

In this brief note, we survey some of the algorithms for computing the primary decomposition of polynomial ideals. Our discussion
takes us through a number of the well known algorithms, focusing in particular on the algorithm due to Gianni, Trager, and Zacharias [GTZ88].
We then turn to a relatively recent addition to the suite of known algorithms, looking at an algorithm due to Masayuki Noro [Nor10], and
discussing a class of examples to which it is well suited.
